# SMS Spam Classifier using Naive Bayes

## Project Overview
This project implements an SMS spam detection system using Python and machine learning.
The model classifies messages as Spam or Ham using NLP techniques and Naive Bayes.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NLP (Bag of Words)

## Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset  
2. Encode labels (Spam = 1, Ham = 0)  
3. Train-test split  
4. Text vectorization using CountVectorizer  
5. Train Multinomial Naive Bayes model  
6. Evaluate using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
7. Confusion Matrix visualization  
8. Test model on custom messages  

## Results
Accuracy: ~97% (depends on random state)

## Future Improvements
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression and SVM comparison
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Streamlit web app deployment
